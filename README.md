# Ants Website

This is a personal webiste built in 2021. 
I use it to test frameworks and libraries. It allowes me to understand how quickly I can spin up, build and deploy using various framewokrs, libraries and functionalities.

For example: CSS is applied using Tailwind's `@apply` directive inside `<style lang="scss">` tag, which makes the code even cleaner and easy to look at, but the downside, at least at the moment, VS Code and Vue.JS extenstions don't know about `@apply` directive and there is a warning in the editor on files it's used.
The benefits is that we have an absolutely clean HTML code. So I can focus on structure of the document, without having to deal with the polution that comes with having the styles applied through `class` property. 


 Tech Stack: 
  - Django
  - Vue.js with TypeScript
  - Vite
  - TailwindCSS
