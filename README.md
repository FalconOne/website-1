# Ants Website

This is a personal webiste built in 2021. 
I use it to test frameworks and libraries. It allowes me to understand how quickly I can spin up, build and deploy using various framewokrs, libraries and functionalies.

For example: CSS is applied using `@apply` keyworod inside `<style>` tag, which makes the code even cleaner and easy to look at, but the downside is VS Code and Vue.JS extenstions don't know about `@apply` keyword and there is a warning in the editor on files it is used.
